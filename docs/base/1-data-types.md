# Data Types

The primitive data types and their properties

---

## Types

**Integral**
* `u8`  - 8 bit  unsigned integer
* `u16` - 16 bit unsigned integer
* `u32` - 32 bit unsigned integer
* `u64` - 64 bit unsigned integer

* `i8`  - 8 bit  signed integer
* `i16` - 16 bit signed integer
* `i32` - 32 bit signed integer
* `i64` - 64 bit signed integer

**Fractional**
* `f32` - 32 bit floating point
* `f64` - 64 bit floating point

**Text**
* `char` - Unicode scalar value
* `str`  - string of Unicode characters

**Other**
* `bool`   - boolean value
* `own<T>` - owned pointer
* `ref<T>` - borrowed pointer

## Default Values

There are no uninitialized values. Variables without definitions will have the following values by default:

* Integers: `0`
* Floats: `0.0`
* `char`: `'\u0'`
* `str`: `""`
* `bool`: `false`
* Pointers: `nil`

---

## Truthiness

All types are truthy when their value is anything other than their default value, and falsy when equal to their default value
