# Nook Experimental Phase Roadmap

## Settled Design Philosophy of Nook

**Goal:**
*A safe and comfortable systems language*
- Intuitive and simple ownership system for memory safety
- Minimalistic and familiar syntax for predictability

**Memory**
- Default allocation behavior
  - Local: stack
  - Global: static
- Explicit heap allocation with `new()`
  - Creates an owned variable

**Ownership**
- Move vs copy default
  - Assignment of owned variables moves ownership and invalidates previous owner
- Explicit copy rules
  - Shallow copy value types with assignment
  - Deep copy pointers and structs with inner ownership with `clone()`
  - Require type to implement a `Clonable` interface for `clone()`

**RAII**
- When values are dropped
  - On exit scope of owner
- Destruction order
  - LIFO
- How destructors are defined
  - Automatically by RAII 
  - Structs can have custom destruction logic
  - Require type to implement a `Deferrable` interface for destructors

**References**
- Allowed or not
  - Allowed one at a time, not assignable, only usable in expressions
  - "Ephemeral borrowing"
- Mutable vs shared?
  - Mutable if var is not `const`
  - No sharing or aliasing
- Can they escape scope?
  - Never

**Functions**
- Pass by value vs reference
  - Both
- Move into functions?
  - Allowed
- Borrow returns allowed?
  - No

**Types**
- Static typing only
- Type inference level
  - Local inference
  - Type annotations optional when type is inferrable
  - Type annotations required when not initializing
- Generics now or later
  - Later
- Default values

**Errors**
- Panic with `panic()`
- Result types
  - Optional returns with `?`
  - Error returns with `!`

**Globals**
- Static variables with `static`
  - Static lifetime and storage
- Constants with `const`
  - Literals and pointers that fit in CPU register are inlined
  - Everything else goes in static storage (read-only)
- Function pointers allowed with `dyn`

**Backend**
- C as portable assembly
- Single-exit functions + cleanup blocks
